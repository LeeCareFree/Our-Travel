this is a React port of <https://github.com/sdras/page-transitions-travelapp>.

some react-transition-group issues are still outstanding as I dont know how to do them.

this is bootstrapped with create-react-app, so usual procedures apply.

this is deployed on Netlify, netlify is bae: <https://page-transitions-react-travelapp.netlify.com>

I owe <https://github.com/xavczen/nextjs-page-transitions> for helping me figure out the transitions because im terrible at transitions.
